# Goals and scope

The **evintro** R package aims at providing some functions and objects
that can be used when learning Extreme Value Analysis (EVA).

- What are the GEV and GEV distributions?

- What are the exponential and Gumbel plots and how do the GPD and GEV
  distributions show on these plots?
  
- ...

The package is still in its infancy!
