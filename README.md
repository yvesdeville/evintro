# Goals and scope

The **evintro** package aims at providing some functions and objects
that can be used when learning Extreme Value Analysis (EVA).

- What are the GEV and GEV distributions.

- What are the exponential and Gumbel plots and how do the GPD and GEV
  distributions show on these plots.

- â€¦

The package is still in its infancy!
